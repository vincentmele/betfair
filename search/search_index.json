If your aim is to take a snapshot of horse markets 3 minutes before the off and at post time, polling (listMarketBook) is a good solution. You will only hit the Betfair API endpoint 2 times per market. But if you want to gather, process and react to data more frequently (e.g. in-play horse racing), polling is inefficient and the reason lies in the way HTTP works. Every time you hit a Betfair API endpoint: Your machine establishes a new connection with the Betfair server. It sends an HTTP request and receives and HTTP response. HTTP requests/responses carry headers, so more data is sent/received. Streaming is more efficient because: The connection gets established once. From that moment, data keeps flowing from Betfair to your machine. There are no data overheads as you would have with polling / HTTP. This results in faster data and less CPU from your machine (and Betfair's) The full docs can be found here Market A market stream can be created like so: import queue import threading import betfairlightweight from betfairlightweight.filters import ( streaming_market_filter , streaming_market_data_filter , ) trading = betfairlightweight . APIClient ( \"username\" , \"password\" , app_key = \"appKey\" ) trading . login () # create queue output_queue = queue . Queue () # create stream listener listener = betfairlightweight .

However 'price point' matched backs and matched lays are stored in the order cache in matched_lays / matched_backs.
